<p style="color: blue">This is a definition list with varying whitespace:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>First Term</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition of the first term.</dd>
  <dt>Second Term</dt>
  <dd>This is one definition of the second term.</dd>
  <dd>This is another definition of the second term.</dd>
</dl>

<p style="color: blue">Here is a definition list with even more whitespace</p>


<dl>
  <dt>First Term</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition of the first term.</dd>
  <dt>Second Term</dt>
  <dd>This is one definition of the second term.</dd>
  <dd>This is another definition of the second term.</dd>
</dl>

<p style="color: blue">Those definition lists should then output the following HTML:</p>

<pre lang="html">
&#60;dl&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;First Term&#60;&#47;dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;This is the definition of the first term.&#60;&#47;dd&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;Second Term&#60;&#47;dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;This is one definition of the second term.&#60;&#47;dd&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;This is another definition of the second term.&#60;&#47;dd&#62;
&#60;&#47;dl&#62;
</pre>

<p style="color: blue">Notice how the HTML is escaped and has a language specifier in the source code?</p>
