# Marcus
## Description:
Marcus is an experimental Markdown parser written in Rust. It uses [regular expressions](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#example-iterating-over-capture-groups) and built-in methods (for the [str](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#implementations) &amp; [String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#implementations) types) to convert Markdown into HTML.

**Warning**: This project is experimental and was created for fun and isn't production tested. Please backup your files when working with file I/O.
