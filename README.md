# Marcus
## Description:
Marcus is a Markdown parser written in Rust, and uses [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to convert Markdown into HTML.

**Note**: that certain test files (`*.md`) aren't rendered properly by Github preview due to a lack of support for the full Markdown specification.

**Warning**: This project is experimental, was created for fun and is not (in any way) production rated or tested, please be cautious.
